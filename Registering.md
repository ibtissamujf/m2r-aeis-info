Registering to AEIS Course
==========================


1. Select a partner
-------------------
Some assignments required to work in pairs so will need a partner.
Choose a partner. If you do not choose one, one will be assigned for
you randomly. This information is required to fill the form mentionned
later.

2. Create a github account
--------------------------
 
Using github is required to deliver the result of your work for some 
assignment. If you already have a github account you can skip this step.
Otherwise you just have to go <https://github.com/join> and choose a free
plan. This should take less than 5 mn. 


3. Fill the AEIS Student form
-----------------------------

Once the github account created, you **must** fill the following form: 
<http://goo.gl/forms/OQO6DVL3JP>

Filling this form will send your information but please allow us
a couple of days to process it. Github invitations (next step)
have to be processed manually so you may have to wait a bit for the next step.

4. Accept the GitHub m2r invitation
-----------------------------------

At some point you will receive an email from github with 
an invitation to the 'm2r' organization. This invitation will be
sent to the email addressed associated with you github account.
Please make sure that this adress is correct and that you specified
the proper github account in the 'AEIS Student Form'.

To accept the invitation you just have to go to the ``m2r organization``
<https://github.com/m2r>. If you are logged in you will see the invitation
on the top of the screen. 

Accepting the invitation will show you more repositories. In particular
a repository for your group. The name of this repository ends with a 
group number like G03. This is your group number.

After the end of assignments, the content of this repository will be
used to evaluate your work. Just make
