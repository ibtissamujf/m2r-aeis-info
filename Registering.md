Registering to AEIS Course
==========================


1. Select a partner
-------------------
Some assignments required to work in pairs so will need a partner.
Choose a partner. If you do not choose one, one will be assigned for
you randomly. This information is required to fill the form mentionned
later.

2. Create a github account
--------------------------
 
Using github is required to deliver the result of your work for some 
assignment. If you already have a github account you can skip this step.
Otherwise you just have to go <https://github.com/join> and choose a free
plan. This should take less than 5 mn. 


3. Fill the Student form
-------------------------

Once the github account created, you **must** fill the following form: 
<http://goo.gl/forms/OQO6DVL3JP>

Please allow us a couple of days to process this information. Github invitations
(next step) have to be processed manually so you may
have to wait in the next step.

4. Accept the GitHub invitation
-------------------------------

At some point you will receive an email from GitHub with 
an invitation to join the ``m2r`` organization. This invitation will be
sent to the email associated with you GitHub account.
Make sure that this adress is correct and that you have specified
the proper GitHub account in the 'Student Form'.

Once invited, you just have indeed to go to the ``m2r organization``
<https://github.com/m2r>. If you are logged in you should see the 
invitation on the top of the screen. 

Accepting the invitation should show you:

1.  The "**info repository**" which provides general information about 
    the course. You have read access to this repository put you can
    post issues to ask questions, etc.
2.  The "**root repository**" which contains assignments,
    work definitions, skeletons for realizing assignements, etc.
    You have read access to this repository put you can
    add comments or questions on work defintions, etc.
3.  Your "**group repository**". This repository is yours.
    Its name ends with a group id like ``G12``. ``G12`` will be your group id.
    You are going to share this repository with other group members.
    All group members have write access and will use it to collaboratively
    implement the assignments.
